EC 601 Homework 1

This homework modified the httpstat.py function.  We modified the the way the script accepts input as
well as added some additional information in the display.  The additional information includes the 
percentage of total time each step of the http request process took.

Included in the repository are screenshots of the our Trello board with our cards that were made
and a screenshot of the burndown chart that was created.
